# Minimize-All-Windows
An Alfred workflow to minimize all windows

Double Click to import.

Call Alfred type `min` or press `commond` + `0`.

Workflow is helping us to trigger two hot-keys:
* Option + Command + H: To view the front app but hide all other apps
* Command + M: Minimize the front window to the Dock

Enjoy it!
